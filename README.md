# cpmp-121-final

## Introducing the Team

### Tools Lead - [Reuben Chavez]
Responsible for researching alternative tools, setting up configurations, and establishing coding style guidelines. Provides support for systems like source control and automated deployment. Also assists in setting up auto-formatting systems.

### Engine Lead - [Gabriel Bacon]
Researches alternative engines and provides direction to team-members on engine-specific syntax. Establishes standards for organizing code into project folders and proposes software designs that insulate the team from underlying engine details.

### Design Lead - [Ben Daly]
Establishes the creative direction of the project, sets the look and feel of the game, and leads discussions on domain-specific language elements. Responsible for creating small art or code samples to help others contribute.

## Production Lead -[Daniel Bustan]
Defines the project scope and deliverable. Responsibilities include but not limited to group scheduling, music production and asset creation. 

## Tools and Materials

### Engines, Libraries, Frameworks, and Platforms
Our team chose to use Godot Engine 4 with GDScript. We made this decision because we wanted to work in an environment that provided a language alternative to Javascript, with the underlying ability to publish to web. We wanted to see how much of our skills from 121 could transfer to another langauge that all of us are a little less familar with.

### Programming and Data Languages
We will be using GDScript for coding, as its an easy-to-read language that allows for web builds. We initially were going to work in C#, but we realized that the potential for a game that can be built for the web is important, and only GDscript provides that.

### Authoring Tools
We plan to use the following tools: Godot Engine Editor, Photoshop, and online resources. We chose these tools as they fit most closely with our encompassing goal while allowing each user a good amount of time to spend on the code. We would rather focus more on the code than the art for this specific project.

## Outlook

### Project Goals
Our team aims to create a Farm Sim game inspired by Fire Emblem. This means that our game will have tile-based movmement with enemies that will attack the farm if not killed before then.

### Project Challenges
The hardest part of this project might be integrating any engine changes Adam makes us do. Since GDscript isn't that complex it might not be too hard, but we may run into issues with texture placement, etc.

### Learning Objectives
By using the selected tools and materials, we hope to learn how to better use the Godot Engine, while . This includes [Specific Skills or Knowledge] that will benefit our team members individually and collectively.
